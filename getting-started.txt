create a virtual environment
$ python3 -m venv .venv

#activate the virtual environment
If youâ€™re using bash or zsh, use:
$ source .venv/bin/activate

install django and django rest framework in the virtual environment
$ pip install django
$ pip install djangorestframework

shows all the commands available
$ django-admin 

start a new project in the current directory (.)
$ django-admin startproject drinks .

run the server
$ python manage.py runserver

applying migrations to the database
$ python manage.py migrate

creating a superuser for the admin panel (username: admin, password: admin) 
$ python manage.py createsuperuser

NOTE : need to add drinks app to the INSTALLED_APPS list in drinks/settings.py
creating a model in drinks/models.py and then running the following commands
$ python manage.py makemigrations drinks
$ python manage.py migrate

we can register differnt tables we want to show on admin panel by creating a file drinks/admin.py
it's just for test purpose, we can delete it later

if anything goes wrong make sure to check the vscode interpreter and select the virtual environment
using the command palette (ctrl+shift+p) and search for python interpreter
